# Span (span)
[docs](https://togglebyte.github.io/anathema-guide/templates/elements/span.html)

A ``span`` element element is used to style text on the same line. Span can not be used on its own, it has to belong to a ``text`` element and does not accept children.

## Example
```
text "start"
    span "-middle-"
    span "end"
```
```
start-middle-end
```
