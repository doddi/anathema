# Expand (expand)
[docs](https://togglebyte.github.io/anathema-guide/templates/elements/expand.html)

Expand the element to fill the remaining space.

Accepts one child.

The layout process works as follows:

First all elements that are not `expand` or `spacer` will be laid out. The remaining space will be distributed between `expand` then `spacer` in that order, meaning if one `expand` exists followed by a `spacer` the `expand` will consume all remaining space, leaving the `spacer` zero sized.

The size is distributed evenly between all `expands`.

To alter the distribution factor set the `factor` attribute.

## Example
```
border [width: 10, height: 11]
  vstack
    expand
      border
        expand
          text "top"
    expand
      border
        expand
          text "bottom"
          text "footer"
```
```
┌────────┐
│┌──────┐│
││top   ││
││      ││
│└──────┘│
│┌──────┐│
││bottom││
││      ││
│└──────┘│
│footer  │
└────────┘
```
## Attributes
### factor
The factor decides the amount of space to distribute between the `expand`s.
Given a height of `3` and two `expand` widgets, the height would be divided by two.
If one of the `expand` widgets had a `factor` of two, then it would receive `2` of the total height, and the remaining widget would receive `1`.

### axis
Expand along an axis.

Valid values:
- `"horz"` | `"horizontal"`
- `"vert"` | `"vertical"`
### fill
Fill the unpainted space with a string.

Example:
```
border [width: 10, height: 5]
   expand [fill: "+-"]
   text "Hello"
```
```
┌────────┐
│Hello-+-│
│+-+-+-+-│
│+-+-+-+-│
└────────┘
```
